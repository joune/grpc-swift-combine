   Automatically retry failed calls up to a maximum number of times, when a condition is met.
   
   - Parameters:
     - upTo: Maximum number of retries. Defaults to 1.
     - when: Retry when condition is true.
     - delayUntilNext: Wait for the next published value before retrying. Defaults to a publisher that immediately
       effectively meaning that there is no delay between retries. `delayUntilNext` is called with the current retry
       count and RPCError.
     - didGiveUp: Called when number of retries have been exhausted. Defaults to no-op.
   
   The following example defines a `RetryPolicy` for retrying failed calls up to 3 times when the error is a `GRPCStatus.unavailable`:
  
   ```
   let retry = RetryPolicy.failedCall(upTo: 3, when: { $0.code == .unavailable }))
   ```
